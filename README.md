Description of how to manage this organization account.

- Example code should be listed on the [dntechsquad](https://github.com/dntechsquad) account. This is for any public completed member projects or example code for classes that isn't well documented enough to be used as educational content.

- Repositories for teaching classes or open source projects should be listed on this repository.

- Private, internal repositories should be stored on [dn-it](https://github.com/dn-it/).
